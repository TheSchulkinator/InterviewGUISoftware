Application to parse csv data change sample rate and output graphs to user

## Synopsis
  This application is used to take a csv file and split it into usable pieces.  The user can export a graph straight into an excel 
  worksheet of the data.  In addition, there is a feature to pick a time interval and see the max, min, and avg for the csv file.  The
  software uses the MVVM architecture to separate the logical components of the view into a separate view model class.  This allows the view 
  to be easily reused for a future use.  Open the demo with Visual Studio 2015 or newer.
